# Easy Check-in App

The Easy Check-in app is focused on finding a better solution for student organizations of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) to keep track of attendance for their events. While the current methods of tracking attendance are not accurate and very time consuming, event attendance is a significant statistic for the event organizers for planning future events and receiving an annual budget from the Student Government Association (SGA). In order to improve current methods for attendance tracking, we decided to simplify the attendance check-in process and apply it to a WPI student’s mobile phone. Following this approach, we built a mobile app that allows students to check in to an event on their phone, taking advantage of mobile devices’ capacity for location-awareness. With this app, we believe attendance taking will be less intrusive and more students will be accounted for, so the accuracy of event attendance will increase.
